# jam-react

Jam is your own embeddable Clubhouse-style audio space. This package exposes Jam as a standalone React component.

```sh
yarn add jam-react
```

Usage:

```js
import Jam from 'jam-react';

<Jam roomId="new-jam-room" />;
```

`<Jam>` supports three props:

- `roomId` - **required**, string, your room ID which also makes the room accessible by navigating to `https://jam.systems/<roomId>`.
- `jamUrl` - optional, string, URL of the jam instance. The default is `https://jam.systems` which you may use freely.
- `params` - optional, allows many customizations that are documented [here](https://gitlab.com/jam-systems/jam#room-configuration-via-url).

Any other props, like `style`, are merged into the top-level `<iframe>` which loads jam. This allows you to add styling, customize `iframe` feature policy etc. Note that Jam needs `allow="microphone"` to work.

Here is a full example with customizations, including setting an identity for the user from outside:

```js
import React from 'react';
import Jam from 'jam-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{padding: '1rem'}}>
      <h1>Jam: My own Clubhouse!!!!</h1>
      <Jam
        jamUrl="http://beta.jam.systems"
        roomId="klubhaus-123456"
        params={{
          room: {
            name: 'A new Jam Room',
            description: 'This Room was created by a React component',
            color: '#000000',
            stageOnly: true,
          },
          ux: {
            autoCreate: false,
            autoJoin: true,
          },
          identity: {
            name: 'Gregor',
            avatar: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989968',
          },
        }}
        style={{width: '400px', height: '600px', border: 'none'}}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

And here is an example with three `<Jam>` components rendered next to each other:
